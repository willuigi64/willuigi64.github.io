                <h2>Lyrics</h2>
                I would be lost
                <br>
                Drifting along
                <br>
                Floating up high
                <br>
                Time after time
                <br>
                And there you'd be
                <br>
                Shining brightly
                <br>
                Your smiling face
                <br>
                To guide my way
                <br>
                <br>
                Bloody and bruised
                <br>
                Brought to my knees
                <br>
                When beaten down
                <br>
                When broken up
                <br>
                You would appear,
                <br>
                Reach out to me,
                <br>
                Heal every wound,
                <br>
                And make me whole
                <br>
                <br>
                Was it all a dream?
                <br>
                Will I never know?
                <br>
                Foolish and blind
                <br>
                To everything
                <br>
                Had I realized,
                <br>
                Had I thought it through,
                <br>
                Would you be here
                <br>
                in my embrace?
                <br>
                <br>
                Shine bright
                <br>
                Once more
                <br>
                Guide me
                <br>
                To you
                <br>
                Smile bright
                <br>
                Once more
                <br>
                This time
                <br>
                I will never let you go
                <br>
                <br>
                With your every smile
                <br>
                Hiding something more:
                <br>
                Dark mysteries
                <br>
                Lurking beneath
                <br>
                But I was consumed
                <br>
                With this emptiness
                <br>
                This selfishness,
                <br>
                This void to fill
                <br>
                <br>
                Hear me
                <br>
                Once more
                <br>
                Show me
                <br>
                Your smile
                <br>
                This time
                <br>
                For sure
                <br>
                I'll see
                <br>
                The truth hidden inside your tears
                <br>
                <br>
                But I
                <br>
                I know
                <br>
                That you're
                <br>
                Long gone
                <br>
                But I
                <br>
                I will
                <br>
                Go on
                <br>
                Howling and hollow

                <h2>About Hollow</h2>
                <!--Hearing Hollow Skies in the Sector 5 Slums at the point in my life I heard it made it an instant favourite of mine, like many songs from Uematsu. Having continued playing the game and completing it, to be given a full performance with lyrics that tie into the character's (and by extension, my own) journey as the game's theme song really touched me. I love Hollow.-->
                <p>
                    Hollow is the official theme song of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Composed by Nobuo Uematsu, lyrics by Kazushige Nojima and performed by Yosh Morita (Survive Said the Prophet). This track is heard once throughout the 30+ hour playtime of Final Fantasy VII Remake at the end credits. The song is from the main character, Cloud Strife's perspective. There is an instrumental arrangement by Yasunori Nishiki titled Hollow Skies that plays in areas of the Sector 5 Slums earlier in the game.
